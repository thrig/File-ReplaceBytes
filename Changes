1.00    September 2016
        * Fix (I hope) bugs reported in [rt.cpan.org #118117] and
          [rt.cpan.org #118119] such that replacebytes now closes the fd
          and pread and pwrite are less prone to misbehave
        * Check that various length and offset values pass SvIOK, which
          in addition to shooting down Nan also kills Inf
        * Disallow NUL characters in filename to replacebytes
        * Maukify Makefile.PL
        * Test::Most for tests and related changes (e.g. t/00-load.t)
