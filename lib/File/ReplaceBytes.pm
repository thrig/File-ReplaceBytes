=head1 NAME

File::ReplaceBytes - read or replace arbitrary data in files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Warning! These system calls are dangerous! Warning!

  use File::ReplaceBytes qw(pread pwrite replacebytes);

  open my $fh, '+<', $file or die "cannot open $file: $!\n";

  # read 16 bytes at offset of 8 bytes into $buf
  my $buf;
  pread($fh, $buf, 16, 8);

  # write these bytes out in various locations to same file
  pwrite($fh, $buf);        # at beginning of file
  pwrite($fh, $buf, 4);     # write just 4 bytes of $buf
  pwrite($fh, $buf, 0, 32); # all of $buf at 32 bytes into file

  # these two are equivalent
  pwrite($fh, $buf, 0);
  pwrite($fh, $buf, length $buf);

  replacebytes('somefile', $buf, 42);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module employs the L<pread(2)> and L<pwrite(2)> system calls to
perform highly unsavory operations on files. These calls do not update
the filehandle position reported by C<sysseek($fh,0,1)>, and will
doubtless cause problems if mixed with any sort of buffered I/O. The
filehandles used MUST be file-based filehandles, and MUST NOT be
in-memory filehandles or sockets...look, I warned you.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 pread

  pread(FH,BUF,LENGTH)
  pread(FH,BUF,LENGTH,OFFSET)

FH must be a file handle, BUF a scalar, LENGTH how many bytes to read
into BUF, and optionally, how far into the filehandle to start reading
at. BUF will be tainted under taint mode. The call may throw an
exception (e.g. if FH is C<undef>), or otherwise will return the number
of bytes read, or 0 on EOF, or -1 on error. L<perlvar/"$!"> may contain
a clue as to why the call errored out; reasons include invalid input
(negative offsets) or a failure from L<pread(2)>.

=head2 pwrite

  pwrite(FH,BUF)
  pwrite(FH,BUF,LENGTH)
  pwrite(FH,BUF,LENGTH,OFFSET)

FH must be a file handle, BUF a scalar, whose LENGTH will be written, or
otherwise a specified LENGTH number of bytes--but not beyond that of
BUF, because that would be so very naughty--optionally at the specified
OFFSET in bytes. If LENGTH is 0, the contents of BUF will be written.
The call may throw an exception if FH is C<undef>. The return value is
the number of bytes written, or -1 on error. L<perlvar/"$!"> may contain
a clue as to why the call errored out; reasons include invalid input
(negative offsets) or a failure from L<pwrite(2)>.

=head2 replacebytes

  replacebytes(FILENAME,BUF)
  replacebytes(FILENAME,BUF,OFFSET)

Accepts a filename and scalar buffer, and writes the buffer to the
specified offset (zero if not specified) in the specified file. Will
create the file if it does not exist. Does not use PerlIO like the C<p*>
routines do, instead performs a direct L<open(2)> call on the filename.
The return value is the number of bytes written, or -1 on error.
L<perlvar/"$!"> may contain a clue as to why the call errored out;
reasons include invalid input (negative offsets) or a failure from
L<open(2)> or L<pwrite(2)>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Everything mentioned above plus yet more besides.

=head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

This module MUST NOT be used if untrusted user input can influence how
the file handles are created, as who knows what the C<p*> system calls
will do with whatever C<fileno> value Perl returns for some socket or
in-memory data filehandle?

have backups, right? Backups are nice.
